# ACL specifies who can do what. If the match section of an entry matches the
# request, the set of allowed actions will be applied to the token request
# and a ticket will be issued only for those of the requested actions that are
# allowed by the rule.
#  * It is possible to match on user's name ("account"), subject type ("type")
#    and name ("name"; for type=repository this is the image name).
#  * Matches are evaluated as shell file name patterns ("globs") by default,
#    so "foobar", "f??bar", "f*bar" are all valid. For even more flexibility
#    match patterns can be evaluated as regexes by enclosing them in //, e.g.
#    "/(foo|bar)/".
#  * IP match can be single IP address or a subnet in the "prefix/mask" notation.
#  * ACL is evaluated in the order it is defined until a match is found.
#    Rules below the first match are not evaluated, so you'll need to put more
#    specific rules above more broad ones.
#  * Empty match clause matches anything, it only makes sense at the end of the
#    list and can be used as a way of specifying default permissions.
#  * Empty actions set means "deny everything". Thus, a rule with `actions: []`
#    is in effect a "deny" rule.
#  * A special set consisting of a single "*" action means "allow everything".
#  * If no match is found the default is to deny the request.
#
# You can use the following variables from the ticket request in any field:
#  * ${account} - the account name, currently the same as authenticated user's name.
#  * ${service} - the service name, specified by auth.token.service in the registry config.
#  * ${type} - the type of the entity, normally "repository".
#  * ${name} - the name of the repository (i.e. image), e.g. centos.
#  * ${labels:<LABEL>} - tests all values in the list of lables:<LABEL> for the user. Refer to the labels doc for details
