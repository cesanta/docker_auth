# To configure Docker Registry to talk to this server, put the following in the registry config file:

#  auth:
#    token:
#      realm: "https://127.0.0.1:5001/auth"
#      service: "Docker registry"
#      issuer: "Acme auth server"

  # Address to listen on.

  # TLS certificate and key.
  certificate: "/path/to/server.pem"
  key: "/path/to/server.key"

token:  # Settings for the tokens.
  issuer: "Acme auth server"  # Must match issuer in the Registry config.
  expiration: 900
  # It is possible configure a different certificate for tokens.
  # If not specified, server certificate is used.
  # certificate: "..."
  # key: "..."

# Authentication methods. All are tried, any one returning success is sufficient.
# At least one must be configured.

# Static user map.

# Google authentication.
# ==! NB: DO NOT ENTER YOUR GOOGLE PASSWORD AT "docker login". IT WILL NOT WORK.
# Instead, Auth server maintains a database of Google authentication tokens.
# Go to the server's port with you browser and follow the "Login with Google account" link.
# Once signed in, you will get a throw-away password which you can use for Docker login.
google_auth:
  domain: "example.com"  # Optional. If set, only logins fromt his domain are accepted.
  # client_id and client_secret for API access. Required.
  # Follow instructions here: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project
  # NB: Make sure JavaScript origins are configured correcly.

# ACL specifies who can do what. If the match section of an entry matches the
# request, the set of actions will be compared and token will be issued if
# all the requested actions are allowed by the entry.
#  * It is possible to match on user's name ("account"), subject type ("type")
#    and name ("name"; for type=repository which, at the timeof writing, is the
#    only known subject type, this is the image name).
#  * Matches are evaluated as shell file name patterns ("globs") by default,
#    so "foobar", "f??bar", "f*bar" are all valid. For even more flexibility
#    match patterns can be evaluated as regexes by enclosing them in //, e.g.
#    "/(foo|bar)/".
#  * ACL is evaluated in the order it is defined until a match is found.
#  * Empty match clause matches anything, it only makes sense at the end of the
#    list and can be used as a way of specifying default permissions.
#  * Empty actions set means "deny everything", special set consisting of a
#    single "*" action means "allow everything".
#  * If no match is found the default is to deny the request.
#
# You can use the following variables from the ticket request in any field:
#  * ${account} - the account name, currently the same as authenticated user's name.
#  * ${service} - the service name, specified by auth.token.service in the registry config.
#  * ${type} - the type of the entity, normally "repository".
#  * ${name} - the name of the repository (i.e. image), e.g. centos.
acl:
  # Admin has full access to everything.
  - match: {account: "admin"}

  # User "test" has full access to test-* images but nothing else.

  # All logged in users can push all images that are in a namespace beginning with their name
  - match: {account: "/.+/", name: "${account}/*"}
    actions: ["*"]
  # Anonymous users can pull "hello-world".
  - match: {account: "", name: "hello-world"}
    actions: ["pull"]
  # Access is denied by default.
