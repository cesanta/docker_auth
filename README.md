Docker Registry 2.0 authentication server
=========================================

The original Docker Registry server (v1) did not provide any support for authentication or authorization.
Access control had to be performed externally, typically by deploying Nginx in the reverse proxy mode with Basic or other type of authentication.
While performing simple user authentication is pretty straightforward, performing more fine-grained access control was cumbersome.

Docker Registry 2.0 introduced a new, token-based authentication and authorization protocol, but the server to generate them was not released.
Thus, most guides found on the internet still describe a set up with a reverse proxy performing access control.

This server fills the gap and implements the protocol described [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/auth/token.md).

Supported authentication methods:
 * Static list of users
 * Google Sign-In (incl. Google for Work / GApps for domain) (documented [here](https://github.com/cesanta/docker_auth/blob/master/examples/reference.yml))

## Installation and Examples

A public Docker image is available on Docker Hub: [cesanta/docker_auth:stable](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/cesanta/docker_auth/).

The binary takes a single argument - path to the config file.

Example command line:

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
$ docker run \
    --rm -it --name docker_auth -p 5001:5001 \
    -v /path/to/config_dir:/config:ro \
    -v /var/log/docker_auth:/logs \
    cesanta/docker_auth /config/auth_config.yml
```

See the [example config files](https://github.com/cesanta/docker_auth/tree/master/examples/) to get an idea of what is possible.

## Troubleshooting

Run with increased verbosity:
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
docker run ... cesanta/docker_auth --v=2 /config/auth_config.yml
```
